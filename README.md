# 🏆 College Sports Analytics Platform

A machine learning web application that predicts outcomes for college football and basketball games using linear regression and advanced performance metrics.

## 📊 Overview

This project combines two sports prediction models into a unified platform. Both models use linear regression to calculate team power ratings from game results, then incorporate efficiency statistics to forecast outcomes and win probabilities.

### Features

**Football Predictor:**
- FBS team power ratings based on game results
- Weekly predictions for all upcoming games
- DraftKings betting line comparison to identify value opportunities
- Efficiency metrics: yards per play, third down conversion, turnover margin

**Basketball Predictor:**
- D1 team ratings updated throughout the season
- Daily game predictions (EST timezone)
- Offensive and defensive efficiency analysis
- Win probability calculations

## 📈 How It Works

### The Model

Both predictors use the same core approach:

1. **Build Design Matrix**: Each completed game creates a row with +1 for the home team and -1 for the away team
2. **Fit Linear Regression**: Find team ratings that minimize prediction error across all games
3. **Calculate Margin**: `predicted_margin = home_rating - away_rating + home_advantage`
4. **Add Efficiency Stats**: Incorporate offensive/defensive metrics and turnover data
5. **Convert to Probability**: Use a sigmoid function to calculate win probability
